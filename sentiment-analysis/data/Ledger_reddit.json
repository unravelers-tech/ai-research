Let me explain :\n  \n    I agree like most of you (I guess), that the use of a passphrase is probably the best option for both plausible deniability and reducing the risk of loss and thief thanks to the necessity to get the 2 factors : seed + passphrase. I agree.\n  \n    However, if you dont make a lot of outgoing transactions and only use your ledger for generating new deposit adresses, it would be an interesting feature in my opinion to force the user to confirm the seed phrase (or a few words) on the device to validate any attempt of outgoing transaction. And of course in case of several mistakes : seed erased.\n  \n    This way, if you keep your seed elsewhere in a secure location, in case of physical threats the security of your funds doesnt rely on your capacity to lie under stressful situations : you dont have to lie about the existence of a passphrase of a second PIN because you just cant make any outgoing transaction even yourself.\n  \n    However, with such a feature, there s a flipside : in case of seed loss, even if you remind your pin, it s over.\n  \n    Look forward to having your opinion about it"

As the most popular choices, I've first looked into getting a Trezor or a Ledger, but there are things I hate about both.\n  \n    Although Ledger has native support for nearly all of the alt coins I want, and seems fairly user-friendly, the fact that they're not fully open-source (AND seem to have a major f*ck-up every few years that destroys trust even further) and invade your privacy in the Ledger Live app with trackers is pretty concerning to say the least.\n  \n    And although Trezor is open source, their alt coin support sucks, native staking in the Trezor Suit is limited and they don't let you choose your preferred validator + take they a commission (even Ledger lets you choose your own validator!!!), they sometimes discontinue support for certain coins, and have a small screen size, which means that even if you're not blind signing transactions (strictly speaking), it may be harder to fully comprehend what you're signing in certain cases.\n  \n    Plus, none of them are air-gapped, which isn't a \"must\", but it's definitely a \"nice-to-have\".\n  \n    In an attempt to overcome the issues I have with the Trezor and the Ledger, I've started looking into other wallets – and I've come across the KeyStone 3 Pro.\n  \n    At first glance, it seems like everything I'm looking for in a hardware wallet, and seems like the PERFECT wallet:\n  \n      \n    \n    Open source firmware\n  \n  \n    \n    Fully air-gapped\n  \n  \n    \n    Large screen and user-friendly interface\n  \n  \n    \n    Support for almost all coins, chains, and tokens\n  \n  \n    \n    It also has extra security features\n  \n  \n    \n    Plus, it has a pretty reasonable price (compared to competitors)\n  \n  \n    \n    BUT after digging some more, I've come across a few potential cons:\n  \n      \n    \n    It's made in China, by a Chinese company (maybe not an issue on its own... then again, maybe it is?) – I'm mostly thinking it may be tampered with before shipping, it might have a built-in backdoor,  pre-loaded seeds, or maybe it's not using true randomness when generating the seeds.\n  \n  \n    \n    Its reviews on Amazon are... not great. Not great at all.\n  \n  \n    \n    I can't find information on whether they've open sourced their hardware as well (like Trezor did).\n  \n  \n    \n    Obviously it's newer than Trezor and has a MUCH smaller user base, so despite being open sourced, there's a higher chance of potential unnoticed errors, backdoors, and security flaws.\n  \n  \n    \n    I guess my questions are:\n  \n      \n    \n    What's the community's overall opinion of the KeyStone 3 Pro wallet?\n  \n  \n    \n    Are there any pros/cons (especially cons) I'm missing?\n  \n  \n    \n    How concerned should I be about the cons I've listed?\n  \n  \n    \n    And does anyone have actual experience with the KeyStone 3 Pro? If so, what's your take on the wallet?"

Intentionally, not intentionally - doesn't make a big difference.\n  \n    So I thought, why don't the hardware wallets show an encrypted seed phrase as a recovery info (they should let you type a password for the encryption process first), and let you recover the wallet by typing 1. encrypted seed phrase 2. password?\n  \n    Why do we even have to deal with unencrypted seed phrases in 2024?\n  \n    And if you know, what would be a good alternative way to store the recovery info?"

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the situation:\n  \n    The Setup:\n  1.\tLast year, a friend transferred ADA to my Ledger wallet.\n2.\tThe ADA balance is visible in my Ledger Live app on both my desktop and phone.\n3.\tThe transaction ID is valid, and when I check the receiving address on CardanoScan, it shows the correct balance.\n4.\tI’m using a Ledger Nano X with a single 24-word recovery phrase.\n    The Issue:\n  1.\tRecovery Phrase Not Fetching ADA:\n    When I use my 24-word recovery phrase in third-party wallets like Yoroi or Typhon Wallet, the ADA balance shows as zero. •\tI believe this is because the recovery phrase is associated with my Ledger Nano X, not the Ledger Live app itself. 2.\tTransfer Attempts Failing: Despite the ADA balance being visible in Ledger Live, I cannot transfer it to Binance. Every transfer attempt results in an error. 3.\tSyncing Issues: •\tInitially, the ADA balance wasn’t visible on my phone Ledger Live app. I resolved this by syncing the app with my desktop. •\tEven though the balance now shows on both devices, the transfer issue persists. 4.\tThird-Party Wallets: •\tI’ve tried connecting the Ledger Nano X to Yoroi and Typhon Wallet through Bluetooth, but the ADA balance isn’t fetched. •\tWhen I attempt to add the wallet manually in Yoroi using the recovery phrase, it still shows a zero balance.\n  \n    What I Know So Far:\n  •\tThe ADA is definitely tied to the address visible in Ledger Live.\n•\tThe transaction history and balance are verified on CardanoScan.\n•\tIt seems the ADA is associated with the Ledger Live app rather than the hardware wallet, which might explain the discrepancy when using the recovery phrase.\n    My Goal:\n  \n    I simply want to access my ADA and transfer it back to Binance or another exchange. However, I’m stuck due to the above issues.\n  \n    Questions for the Community:\n  1.\tIs it possible that the ADA is somehow tied to the Ledger Live app rather than the Ledger Nano"

This is my main set of keys that I’ve been using since the start of my crypto journey and I’ve been learning along the way.\n  \n    I’ve recently been looking into the 25th word passphrase option and think this could be a good option. If I create a 25th word passphrase wallet, I could just move some/most of my assets over to this new wallet right? Since it functionally operates as a new set of private keys as if I created a brand new wallet altogether?\n  \n    My other option is to go full reset and set up brand new private keys: set up brand new keys with some hot wallet->transfer assets from old accounts to new accounts on hot wallet->wipe ledger->create new keys on ledger->move assets back->update cryptosteel backup with new seed phrase.\n  \n    The 2nd option is obviously more secure but will be a pain in the rear.

When I gave it to her, suddenly the connection dropped (she hung up?) and that seems to be it.

This is my story, many have come before me.\n  \n    Let me begin. I embarked on a Doge BTC swap with Challengy who then requested KYC. I thought to myself \"no big deal\". I provided them with the credentials they asked for giving my private and personal data away. They went above and beyond the aforementioned KYC policy and then begin act  and live action role play as if they are a sovereign power with governing authority over my funds accusing me of guilt and leaving my habeas corpus to the wind. Below are some screenshots which show my story. Let this be a warning to all users of crypto currency to learn from my mistake and to put a keen eye of due diligence over their services. Many in the industry have reported they rehypothicate users funds, and speculate with customer collateral. With holding funds over asinine reasons acting as if they are the police. If my funds are not returned I will have to report the funds as stolen to the relevant authorities in Hong Kong, France, Saint-Vincent and the Grenadines Kingstown and the United States.

In the final screenshot, you can see that, after I have tapped Validate Memo in the second screenshot, \"From\" has changed to \"XLM\", and 100 USDC has changed to 100 XLM, which is roughly 20 USDC, which is not at all what I intend to do.\n  \n    What the hell did Ledger do to their USDC transfers?

I THINK they took all my XRP? Tho oddly months after they did help me my XRP was still there?!  Now thankfully I was only tinkering with buying crypto. Since I'm pretty clueless to it. I finally was able to log into one of my accounts - because I made my password so ridiculously hard (and apparently I didn't write down the correct secret key).\n  \n    Anyhow, so I'm on Trust Wallet and i clicked on Select Asset. I choose XRP - it shows a whopping 10 XRP in there. Under transactions, it's showing going to another wallet obviously. Unless I somehow transferred it there? I don't know it was back in April.  and below that, you can see I xfer'd it from Uphold. So 1 day later it shows it left my acct. Where would I have moved it too? I remember him specifically saying I can see it all on assetxledger(dot com i'm assuming) nothing comes up for it. But I also can't find anything online for that link, and i know I have seen stuff on my screen when I put in there before. I'm sorry I'm not good at asking the right questions in here. Because honestly I have no clue. But hey, 268 xrp I got dirt cheap may pay off one day! Can someone explain to me this transaction I'm seeing and how do I know if it actually went into someone else's hands? Maybe that link was fake? (i'm guessing so).

    "body": "Hi.\n  \n    This is unnecessarily long, so the TL;DR: is that I reset my Ledger, and can't seem to get back in. I want to say from the beginning that this is not a Ledger issue, it is a user issue, and as such, nobody here owes me a bit of help. It is my hope that someone is kind enough or bored enough to nudge me in the right direction, if one exists.\n  \n    I decided to purchase a Ledger Nano Plus last year, just generally for the heck of it. It seemed/seems like a good learning experience. I do not intend to invest much if anything in crypto, and it has no pressing use case for me, I simply like tinkering with new technology that I have little understanding of. And with that in mind, I picked one up and started tinkering, with a mind toward the \"Don't invest what you can't lose\" credo. And I haven't, this little investment was never meant to earn money, I saw it along the same lines as buying a Hallicrafters SX22 to restore. It passes time during retirement, and matbe keeps my brain awake, but I am by no means like most of you. My use case for a Ledger is a sophisticated toy, not a legitamite tool.\n  \n    I set up various accounts on the ledger, paired some of them with outside wallets like Metamask and Trust, and generally had a good time. I even purchased a few Unstoppable Domains, set them up as wallets, and pointed some at a little Web2 hobby website I run. Again, this is all in good fun. Ultimately, the Ledger had maybe $300 in it. More than I had expected, and more than I *prefer* to lose but still not an amount that will take food off my families table, were push come to shove. I am annoyed at myself, but not worried.\n  \n    The other night, I tried to input the PIN, and must have fat fingered it and reset the wallet. No problem, I thought, I opened the gun safe containing the little paper that the Ledger came with, and I input the recovery phrase. And it seemingly worked. This was around the same time that the Poly <---> Ledger transfers were degraded. This was a few mights ago, when Ledger apparently had some issue with Polygon. Without really thinking, I bought a few $2 (whatever) domains and transferred them to the Polygon wallet on the Ledger. The Polygon<---> Ledger delayed the domain from showing up, but it eventually did. So my wallet appears as normal. The few NFTs and a few hundred bucks in Poly ETH, Tether etc are there. However, when I tried to send from the Ledger to another wallet, I receive am error:\n  \n    ___\n  \n    Something went wrong\n  \n    Please check that your hardware wallet is set up with the recovery phrase or passphrase associated to the selected account. Learn more\n  \n    ____\n  \n    Oh, I can actually log into the Unstoppable Domains account where these UD NFTs associated with these wallets exist.\n  \n    Now full disclosure: After far fingering the PIN and restoring, I discovered that, aside from the nice little stationary card Ledger gives you, I had several pieces of paper with (mostly) the same seed phrase, with one or two words out of order, or with some words (example that is NOT related to my seed) \"sing\" and \"sting\". All deviations are valid BIP 39 words. I'm not a drinker, but I must have slammed something down my throat when setting this wallet up, because this is the only way i could have done something so short sighted.\n  \n    So, might anyone be willing to shed a little light on my short-sightedness? Knowing what I did would be great, but recovering the money and UD would be the bees knees. And since I have about four different versions of the 24 word pass, all only differing betwen one word or so, any simple brute force software able to run through the possible combinations of just those few things would be helpful. I glanced over several Github projects already, and wrote a little script to validate the probably passphrases against the official word list, but other than that, I'm not seeing anything helpful. Is there?\n  \n    Please be assured that, while I am absent minded from time to time - like, midnight to 11:59PM, I am not a trusting man. I will respond to any generous enough to help me in public, but \"Sure I can fix that for you, just send me your key\" DMs will be met with sad looks down and head shakes. Capitalism has brought out some of the best in humankind, but it has unquestionably also brought out the worst.\n  \n    Thanks for reading all this, and here is hoping everyone had a great long weekend.\n  https://preview.redd.it/confused-by-my-own-confusion-v0-xm27el5cmi0e1.jpg"

During a recent move, I misplaced the seed phrase for my Ledger. I bought some BTC a while ago, and to be honest, I didn’t think much of it back then, but now that BTC’s gone up, I’d be gutted if I lost access.\n  \n    The Ledger firmware hasn’t been updated in years and I’m hesitant to do it now in case it bricks the device, especially since I don’t have the seed phrase to restore it. I’ve heard that some firmware updates can require a full restore, so I don’t want to risk anything without a solid plan.\n  \n    It’s not just BTC on there—I’ve got a few other coins too, like NEO, ICX, and ETH. I’m considering transferring everything to different wallets temporarily, but I’m unsure what the best approach is. I’m wondering if I should move supported coins like BTC and ETH to Coinbase temporarily, while finding other safe options for legacy coins like NEO and ICX.\n  \n    Would it be smarter just to buy a new Ledger, set it up with a new seed phrase, and transfer everything to the new device? I can still access my funds on the old Ledger since I know the PIN, but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s done this in case there are any potential issues to watch out for.\n  \n    Or... should I try updating the current Ledger’s firmware after moving the funds, then wipe it and start fresh once I know it’s working?

I'm going to be specific to Ledger, but this applies to most electronic cold storage devices\n  \n      \n    \n    Transfer your crypto back your Dex or exchange provided it does not use the same seed phrase.\n  \n  \n    \n    Generate a new seed phrase on the same ledger device.\n  \n  \n    \n    As you should have a physical copy of you old phrase during the original setup process.\n  \n    3. record on paper with a pen. Your new seed phrase.\n  \n    4.CHECK YOU HAVE RECORDED THE WORDS CORRECTLY. 4.1 CHECK YOU HAVE RECORDED THE WORDS CORRECTLY. 4.2 write it on a second paper. And hide them.\n  \n    5. Install the apps specific to the crypto you own and wish to save to your Ledger.\n  \n    6. Send a small test amount to your Ledger of  crypto you wish to store. Before you send the full amount. Check it has arrived safely.\n  \n    7. Understand this may cost you fees.\n  \n    8. Cold storage means you are responsible for your pass phrase and only those with access to your pass phrase, can access your wallet.\n  \n    9) the PIN you created to protect your Ledger allows you to generate public keys for your accounts you created on your Ledger device attached and connected to the ledger app.\n  \n    10. However you do not need to have your Ledger device connected to your app to send or receive crypto once the public key exist for that same address, the app and password is all you need. (Passphrase and password are not the same thing)\n  \n    11. nobody giving you advice in a private message on any part of the internet is helping you. Not one person. The only advice you should take will be in the open, where it can be scrutinized by others. Do not act on that advice immediately.\n  \n    12. Do not tell anyone your password to your Ledger unless you trust them completely. Same for your passphrase. Same for your hand written paper copy.\n  \n    13. And if you need help from a friend or family member to set up a ledger then get them to show you how to do this. Run through it a couple times. Reset your device and set it up on your own, before you transfer crypto. Nobody but you and possibly your spouse should know.\n  \n    Never record you passphrase on an electronic device. I see no reason for you to carry your Ledger around, find somewhere nice for it to live. If it gets misplaced or stolen as long as you have your passphrase (seed) secure you are good.\n  \n    Enjoy the ponsi scheme. Remember to take a profit and get out at the top."

Mind you, I am a NYS resident.

    "body": "Hello, Reddit community,\n  \n    I'm reaching out to warn you all about a recurring scam operation that has been exploiting the cryptocurrency community on Reddit, specifically targeting users in subreddits like ledgerwallet and CryptoCurrency and probably others. This scammer operates a fake subreddit, cryptoleak(s), where they use deceptive posts to lure unsuspecting users into clicking wallet-draining links. Despite repeated reports, this activity has continued for a month now, and Reddit has yet to take action.\n  \n    The ScamPattern:Recently, I've noticed a troubling trend: various stories get posted across the crypto community, some positive, some negative, but all ultimately serve the same malicious purpose. Here’s what typically happens:\n  \n      \n    \n    Fake Positive Stories: Positive stories get posted and either contain or eventually get edited to include a link to a wallet-draining site. These links typically lead to the subreddit cryptoleak(s), a fake subreddit full of scam posts and fake documentation that appears legitimate. Once there, users are directed to a counterfeit AMLBot site or a fraudulent revoke(dot).cash page that steals their assets.\n  \n  \n    \n    Fake Preventative Guides on Negative Stories: When negative stories or warnings are posted, the scammer group immediately jumps in, posting advice on “how to prevent getting drained.” These comments or posts also link back to cryptoleak(s), leading users through fake guides on contract revocation or wallet protection, which again are designed to drain wallets.\n  \n  \n    \n    Organized Effort to Bury Legitimate Warnings:When I posted a warning about this scam, it initially gained over 150 upvotes, bringing visibility to this issue. However, within hours, the scammer used bot accounts or alternate accounts to downvote my post aggressively, bringing it from 150+ upvotes to below -20, effectively burying it from view. Meanwhile, the scam posts in cryptoleak(s), often posted by CuddlyBubbles69, are quickly boosted with fake “satisfied customer” comments and likes, making them appear trustworthy.\n  \n    Efforts to Report the Scammer:I have tried every reporting option available on Reddit, but so far, no action has been taken. In fact, I received a warning from Reddit, claiming I was abusing the system and spam-reporting this user, which is frustrating given that my goal is only to prevent further harm in the community.\n  \n    What You Can Do to Help:\n  \n      \n    \n    Upvote this post to keep it visible and warn others about these scams.\n  \n  \n    \n    Report CuddlyBubbles69 and the cryptoleak(s) subreddit for fraudulent activity. Hopefully, with enough reports, Reddit will recognize the severity of this issue.\n  \n  \n    \n    Stay cautious of any posts in ledgerwallet, CryptoCurrency, or other related subs claiming to provide protection from wallet drainers, especially if they link to fake AMLBot or revoke(dot)cash sites.\n  \n  \n    \n    This has been an exhausting battle, but I’m determined to protect users from falling into this trap. While I know we can’t stop these scammers entirely, with enough support from this community, we can at least slow them down or make it harder for them to continue their harmful activities. Thank you for any help you can provide, and please stay vigilant."

Unfortunately, my old device from 2017 is damaged—the display doesn’t turn on anymore after plugging it in, so I can’t use it to access or confirm anything.\n  \n    I bought the new device from Amazon - which is listed as trusted seller. Since I’ll receive my new Ledger Nano S tomorrow and want to make sure it’s genuine, I’ve done some research on the verification steps. Here’s what I plan to do:\n  \n      \n    \n    Check the Packaging: Ensure it has all the right items, like the Ledger device, micro USB cable, recovery sheets (which should be blank), and accessories like the keychain/lanyard. Also, confirm that the box has the Ledger branding.\n  \n  \n    \n    Inspect the Recovery Sheets: They should be completely blank. If there’s anything pre-filled, I’ll consider that a huge red flag since Ledger never provides recovery phrases with their products.\n  \n  \n    \n    Device Initialization: When I power it on, I’ll be looking for the welcome message: “Welcome to Ledger Nano S.” I know that the device should not come with a pre-set PIN code.\n  \n  \n    \n    Perform the Genuine Check via Ledger Live:\n  \n      \n    \n    Download Ledger Live directly from Ledger’s official site.\n  \n  \n    \n    I checked the authenticity of my Ledger Live download already using this Ledger Support article\n  \n  \n    \n    Connect the new Ledger Nano S to my computer and open the “My Ledger” section in the app.\n  \n  \n    \n    Wait for Ledger Live to automatically check and confirm if the device is genuine.\n  \n  \n    \n  \n    \n    Since I can’t use my old Ledger anymore, I’m feeling a bit extra cautious this time around. Does anyone have any additional tips or things to look out for?\n  \n    Should I maybe also generate a new seed phrase first and test around a bit before resetting the device and restoring my real seed phrase \"containing\" assets?\n  \n    Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions folks!"

I know in theory that just one set of 24 words should be enough to prevent any potential hack, but I just want to future proof the best I can.\n  \n      \n    \n    using a passphrase in Ledger, is 3 separate passphrases for one set of 24 words virtually as safe as 3 different sets of 24 words?\n  \n  \n    \n    if I want to recover or use the wallets, how will it work? Do I need to remember 4 sets of 24 words and passphrases (3 separate plus 1 original) , or 1 set of 24 words plus 3 passphrases?\n  \n  \n    \n    in regards to 3rd party wallets that I use for xdc and hbar, will I also need to remember the recovery phrases also?? Or are those wallets strictly used to transfer to Ledger and then they're disposable afterwards, or will I need to maintain them.\n  \n  \n    \n    any tips, issues, guidance, better ideas for self storing long term holdings, and simplicity for recovery?\n  \n  \n    \n    what's the difference between a pinned and temporary pin/passphrase??\n  \n  \n    \n    Thanks a lot to anyone who can help me out\n  \n    Edit: #5"

I would appreciate your responses to the following:\n  \n    1. I understand that Ledger currently does not support viewing SPL tokens on the Solana network in the Ledger Live interface. Could you explain the reason for this delay, especially considering that Solana is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is a strong contender in the current bull run?\n  \n    2. If I purchase $5,000 worth of Dogwifhat (WIF meme coin) at a price of $2 on Binance, I would receive approximately 2,500 WIF tokens. If I then send these 2,500 WIF tokens to my Solana address on Ledger, will the value of $5,000 be reflected in my Solana Ledger account, even though I cannot view the tokens in Ledger Live?\n  \n    3. It it wise to hold Dogwifhat (WIF meme coin) in the main Solana address on my Ledger? While WIF is often considered a \"shitcoin,\" it has a dedicated community that supports its meme culture. Is there a risk that holding WIF tokens (due to termed as 'shitcoin') on my Solana address could expose me to hacks, despite the private key being secured by the secure element system?\n  \n    4. If I add 2,500 WIF tokens to my Solana address on Ledger, and IF this only allow me to see a value of $5,000 in Ledger Live? Would it be a wise decision not to connect my Ledger to any extensions or hot wallets for viewing my WIF balances? Instead, could I simply copy my Solana address from Ledger and paste it into explorers like Solscan or Sol FM for VIEWING balances/amount of WIF Tokens?\n  \n    I appreciate your assistance in addressing my questions, as I am saving this money for my father’s medical treatment next year. May we all find success in this bull run.\n  \n    Best regards,\n  https://preview.redd.it/attention-spl-tokens-on-solana-address-in-ledger-dogwifhat-v0-yyjkkk1dv5yd1.jpg"

However, I can’t send the BTC from my Ledger Live mobile app because I don’t have a Nano X device with Bluetooth (I have the Nano S, not Nano X).\n  \n  \n    \n    When I go back to the desktop app, I can’t see the BTC in my account anymore.

    "body": "Couple days ago I received a scam called from couple of blokes claiming to be detectives from the UK, they asked if they were speaking to me (Full name)and went on to say that they had someone in custody that was trying to board plane destined to Australia, this particular person they had in custody had been caught with 500 people's details on there devices. They went on to say that the person had a physical licence of mine, 24 word seed phrase, my banking details, and details of eight other exchanges. They asked if I'd been involved in any scams recently and my detail's stolen that I knew about, they said they were from the Manchester detective unit and also supplied me with a badge numbers which ended in F (economical cyber investigators) which I asked for, in the background you could hear what seemed to be a police station. After a lengthy conversation he wanted me to put a report into action fraud website which he navigated me through and told by wording what he wanted reported, he said that my crypto would be covered by (coincover)and my banking would be insured by (fbd) or something in the similar nature of that if it was a group and they managed to get in to my accounts. They then seem to be more focused on my Ledger and claiming that the 24 word seed phrase was linked. He said that he'd been working with Ledger regarding the investigation and that Ledger were complying in making sure Ledger wallets were not compromised. So 20 minutes later I received a phone call from supposedly Ledger agent saying that they wanted to start a case number and confirm my email which at the time was giving them a different one. That email was very slow to come through which he replied I have a different one here on file can I send it to that, he then navigate me to an area on the ledger live and said you can match the two emails up too confirm that this is genuine (which the emails matched)(care@ledger.fr) from the address he was sending from and what Ledger claims to be a legitimate email on their website. Once all that was confirmed he said that he didn't want 24 word phrase and stressed it's something that they'd never asked for, but he wanted me to shut down the ledger live built onto my laptop, open a new link (https//ledgerdevicecheck.com) And wanted me to connect my wallet so it could be rebooted back to factory. That's where for me the biggest red flag hit. I refuse to comply!! which he said that's fine l understand and I'm going to end this case number and contact the detective back and say that you will not comply, so the detective call me back a little bit pissed that I wouldn't comply with Ledger and that how serious the nature is of the investigation and couldn't understand why I wouldn't comply seem's so many other people had. Anyway end of story then  contacted Ledger and they say it was a scam, but won't explain how these people are using the same email confirmed on ledgers website to be legitimate, I also contacted the Manchester police which sad these detectives weren't from their units! but said they could be a different unit and to contact action fraud , action fraud said that's probably a scam because detectives would never give you details of someone thay had in custody. This was a very sophisticated setup at times was very convincing. But the world could be falling apart and I could have soldiers at my front door and I'd never give up my Ledger.

Not recalling which ones and how much of each. However when I attached the NanoX to my computer and tried adding the accounts above, they all came up empty ($0 - not even any dust!). I then ordered a NEW nano S plus and tried adding my 24 word seed phrase to it, same result, 0$ funds across all these accounts.\n  \n    I was goofing around with metamask and MEW at the time, so I tried a new metamask wallet and signed in with my NanoX. The top 5 eth accounts all had 0 eth in them... didnt know what next steps with metamask should be?\n  \n    Using MEW + theta (m/44'/60'/0'/0) I was able to find theta and tfuel. The theta wallet address matches my ledger eth wallet address (with the difference of capitalization). So I've got the right 24 seed phrase.\n  \n    Could the fact Im not finding assets have to do with wallet derivation? Is there a script I can use to scan all the possible Eth/BTC addresses derived from my eth pub key, to find assets or previous transactions on Ledger/Metamask/MEW? Already tried ethscan on the pub address, no previous transactions - expect a few I just ran.\n  \n    If you got this far, thanks!"

First we did top to bottom the way they’re numbered, and then we tried left to right just in case he wrote them down wrong. The last word was written down as “dump,” which wasn’t an option, so we’ve been trying “dumb” instead since it was the most similar word. We still haven’t had any luck, but he believes the first 3 words are definitely correct, if not all of them. Does anyone have any tips or advice?\n  \n    He’s learning how to code for school, but doesn’t know how to write a script. If anyone could offer some help or knows how to code, a script could be helpful.\n  \n    We also saw a post about there being 2,048 words, and it would only take him about 2 months to enter all of the possible combinations if he did 1000 combos a day. I guess that’s the worst case scenario, but he’s willing to do it if nothing else works.\n  \n    Edit: I was wrong about the last part!! Math is not my strong suit :p"

Wanted to swap it immediately to Tether BEP20, and guess what - Changelly charged $56 in exchange fee! It's obscene and feels like a total rip-off.\n  \n    I then stumbled on this sub-reddit to see similar complaints about the swap fee, and even worse, the KYC issues with Changelly. Suffice to say, no one here, including me, is impressed with this Swap feature on Ledger. In fact, it's scary how they can end up holding your hard-earned money over KYC complexities.\n  \n    So what are my options here? I like this Ledger wallet for it's security and functionalities, and don't really wish to return or discontinue it's use.\n  \n    But there are often times I will want to convert BTC or other crypto currencies to USDT to hedge, and if it is going to cost so much, besides with this KYC sword hanging over our head always, it's going to be a real pain.\n  \n    P.S. - I have no problem being compliant through KYC measures, it's just a tedious and scary process apparently when it comes to Changelly."

Should this situation persist, I will initiate a lawsuit to recover the full amount due.\n  \n    The seriousness of this matter cannot be overstated, and I demand that it be handled with the urgency it requires.

On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.\n  \n    So I was wondering if there are better alternatives to swap cryptos like USDT to BTC to send them to my ledger.\n  \n    Generally I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but its a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance, which happens to be expensive overall).\n  \n    I'm thinking of just stacking for several months multiple swaps in Binance and only do two movements per year or something like that.\n  \n    Long story shorthttps://www.rocketx.exchange/andhttps://trocador.app/\n  \n    Best options"

Why did DHL not tell me twice. Why did FedEx not tell me and why did Parcelforce tell me it was lost opposed to returned. So again, anyone else living Brexit nightmare no. 4billion and 1 ? Amazon have said it will now be delivered by DHL, but I have been told that a few times before...."

    "body": "Hi, I accidentally lost my 24-word recovery phrase, but I still have access to my Ledger Nano X.\n  \n    I'm most worried about my assets on the Ethereum mainnet and I am trying to figure out how to transfer all my assets to a new Ledger account minimizing the gas transaction fees.\n  \n    I have two Ethereum wallets on my Ledger with the following assets:Wallet 1:\n  \n      \n    \n    Some ETHs\n  \n  \n    \n    Wallet 2:\n  \n      \n    \n    Some ETHs\n  \n  \n    \n    ERC20 tokens on one contract\n  \n  \n    \n    ERC1155 tokens on one contract\n  \n  \n    \n    ERC721 tokens on 6 different contracts, including one ENS pointing to the Wallet 2 address, which needs to be updated\n  \n  \n    \n    Question 1: Is there a way to batch all the transfer and update ENS record transactions to save some gas fees?\n  \n    Question 2: The Ledger Support says to transfer all the asset to a temporary account, then reset the Ledger and transfer all the assets from the temporary account to the newly created ledger account. This is clearly gas inefficient because all the assets need to be transferred twice. It would be great if I could create a new Ledger account without deleting my present account, then transfer everything to the new account and delete the previous account. This could be obviously achieved using a second Ledger, but I don't own an other ledger, so I was wandering if there is some other way to avoid the double transfer, like extracting the private keys from Ledger and importing them on Metamask, or creating a new account on Ledger without losing access to the previous one.\n  \n    Please let me know if you can help me ❤️!"

Secret phrase configuration went smooth and so the phrase confirmation; also the Nano X has been correctly matched to my iPhone 15. I fired up Ledger Live app on my iPhone only to find out, to my great surprise, that you cannot update the firmware via Bluetooth with the iPhone?! I mean, the Nano X is a Bluetooth device for connecting to a mobile phone, so, how is that even logical? The firmware on the Nano is V 2.0.2 and the version available is V 2.2.3. I don’t have a PC or Mac (the only PC that I have is my work computer, but I cannot install anything on it). This is very, very disappointing and I hope I’m just doing something wrong. Any suggestions?\n  \n    Cheers.\n  \n    Update 1: currently looking at Blockstream Jade as an alternative. You can find information at this URL. A second update will follow when I confirm the compatibility."

    "title": "Ledger Scam",
    "body": "This just happened tonight.\n  \n    First I get a random phone call. Woman with a British accent asks me if I had just recovered my ledger. I say no. She asks if I'm in the Netherlands. Again, no. So she says an investigation has been opened and that someone will call me shortly advise next steps.\n  \n    Meanwhile I get an email from Ledger with a case number (different from the one she gave me though) and the subject is Ledger recovery. Seems legit!\n  \n    Shortly after I get the phone call and Adam (again British accent) starts telling me I likely have corrupted firmware on my device. Bad timing on my part as I had just did a firmware update on my device just a day or two ago. Now I'm getting hooked even more. So he then tells me that someone was able to recover my private keys to another device and now they only need my pin to be able to do transactions and that they'd likely have that cracked in 4 to 6 hours. Again, alarm bells are going off in my head but I'm still trying to process the email I got from Ledger and it showed verified from that domain.\n  \n    Here's where I start getting bad vibes again. He sends me to a ledger diagnostic site. I won't post the link in case anyone tries to use it. So he says whatever you do, don't unlock your device. We can do a diagnostic of it wirelessly and it will check your firmware to see if it's legit. So I do this without unlocking my Nano X and I get a red error code which he informs me is a key logger. At some point I run it again with my Nano X powered off and get the same error code. Then I run it wirelessly against my Nano S which isnt' even wireless (lol) and get the same error code. He claims it's because it's just checking the mac address of the last device firmware update.\n  \n    Now he says we should use the recovery feature to generate new private keys and he wants me to enter my seed words. Alarm bells are saying no way. Never say those words or put them on a computer. He tells me I'll be eligible for up to $50k in insurance through Coincover, but since they've contacted me and advised me of the recovery, that it could affect compensation if I don't follow procedure. So now I'm stressed about this 4 to 6 hour window, and the potential non coverage of my losses. I still can't do it. Too many flags. I ask him to call me back in 30 mins.\n  \n    So now I message some buddies about this but no one responds. So I get on another computer that doesn't even have Ledger Live installed and never used it with my devices. I go to that diagnostic site again and run the diagnostic against wrong device and always get the same stupid error code. Feeling more confident it's a scam.\n  \n    Next I start a chat with the bot on Ledger. Ask it a question about Ledger Recover because I'm trying to find out if that diagnostic link is legit. It immediately sends me an email with a case number that looks identical to the one the caller had supposedly sent. Ah ha! That's how they sent the email!\n  \n    Next I see that someone replied to my email about the asking if I had a question about Ledger Recover! So I reply to the email and briefly mention that someone from ledger called had me use that diagnostic site.\n  \n    a couple minutes later the guy calls back. So he asks if I have any other questions and what I'd like to do. So I tell him that I opened another case with Ledger asking about my case and the diagnostic site link.\n  \n    CLICK\n  \n    He just hung up!\n  \n    I'm just sharing in case anyone else gets a similar call! I know there's tons of red flags in this scam, but using the Ledger chat bot to send a target an email directly from Ledger was the main thing that kept me hooked. Ledger emailed me right after I confirmed that I had not recovered my Ledger and they said I'd get an email with a case number.\n  \n    Digging further on the phishing campaigns link, I does say that Ledger will never contact you by phone.  The main convincing thing was the email I got right after talking to her."
